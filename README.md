## **What We Built **

We developed a system that lets MLB™ fans choose their favorite teams and players to follow, receiving regular text digests with the latest highlights and news. Our solution supports English, Spanish, and Japanese speakers. By leveraging Google Cloud's Gemini AI, we've created personalized highlight reels and text-based updates tailored to each fan's preferences, automatically delivering relevant content based on their selected teams and players.
